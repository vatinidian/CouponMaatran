# CouponMaatran
React web application to exchange coupons (This is a Learning app )
<br/>
<b>Idea</b> :
  Usually many of our coupons / vouchers will get wasted due to many factors or we dont have the required coupon which we wanted. This could be avoided if we share /exchange coupons with other coupon which we want or we can buy for money with less price (Both Buyer and Seller Profits).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Using this application, coupons can be exchanged among the community of people or in a corporate environment, basically among the closed trustable group. So this application does not need to handle the Money Transaction or any transaction problem.
  1. Exchange Coupons with other's coupon
  2. Exchange coupons for money (Users can negotiate to buy and seller can select from best)
  3. No Monetary transactions are handled by this app.
  4. Location of the Seller / Buyer will be shared (only if allowed by the respective user) and users can select to either pick coupon or get the coupon delivered by seller. This could be possible, since this app is for closed community , people could easily meet and trust each other.
  5. Users can rate each other which will boost the trust score and users will be blocked either based on low trust score or any legal issues.
  6. Notification system to notify user about buyer interest on coupons , negotiation , bidding (?) , messaging (?).
